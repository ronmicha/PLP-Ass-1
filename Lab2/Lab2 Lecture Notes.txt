PPL Lab2 instructions:
-	We have Users JSON & Transactions JSON
-	Can be done in Py2 or Py3

Part A:
1.	Given a transaction you look at the past, not at the present and future
2.	Choose the categories which are likely to have subscriptions - electricity, payments...
	Not food etc.
3.	Precision is more important than runtime
4.	Consider checking the "location" feature in a transaction (if not NULL) for predicting whether it's a subscription or not. May be a possible feature
5.	Consider checking the transaction name (if not NULL) to decide if subscription or not
6.	For the income prediction task - add features such as average weekly income, average monthly income...
7.	When adding features to transactions - their value must be set ONLY by PAST data relative to transaction date
8.	Example: A transaction can have 10 features related(?) to a week, 10 more features related(?) to month, 10 more features related(?) to subscription
9.	We must convert the dates in the transaction to day in the week for the weekly prediction task.
10.	If we want to predict for week number 5, we look only at the PAST data at week 5. NO OTHER PAST WEEKS.
11.	Yoni is arguing hardcore with Moshe that I don't understand, seems like this assignment makes no sense...

Part B
1.	Each USER will have its own 2 personal models: weekly income & monthly income
2.	Apart of those there will be one more non-personal model for subscription.
	So for 10 users there will be total of 21 models.
3.	Non-personal model means that the model will have non-personal features.
4.	Feature extraction is per user. But the non-personal model will include the features for all users.
5.	When building the model we need to choose a specific function - tanh, expo, sigmoid, and choose the best

Part C
1. I'm outta here!!!!!!!!!!!!
